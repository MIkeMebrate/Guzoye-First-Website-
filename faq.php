        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <div class="label">Online Booking Related</div>
        <div class="content">
          <h3>How do I buy a ticket on Guzoye.com ?</h3>
          <p>
            You can book the tickets online which is a very simple three step
            process. We advise you to book your tickets at least two hours
            before scheduled departure. After you purchase your ticket you will
            receive an email confirmation that also serves as your boarding pass
            for most of the bus partners. We don't oversell our schedules, so
            this boarding pass will guarantee you a seat on your ticketed
            schedule.
          </p>
          <h3>What happens when my schedule/service is cancelled?</h3>
          <p>
            We'll make every effort to ensure that your travel is not affected
            by providing alternate services to help you reach the destination.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Do I have to pay extra when compared to buying the tickets offline?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Guzoye does not charge anything extra when compared to the
            traditional way (offline). The tickets are absolutely at the same
            cost that the travel bus partner has priced them.
          </p>
          <h3>How does your boarding process work?</h3>
          <p>
            Please arrive at the pick-up point a minimum of 15 minutes before
            departure. Please have your SMS confirmation (or ticket printout in
            some cases) and government issues personal identification ready
            while boarding.
          </p>
          <h3>I’ve lost my ticket printout. What do I do now?</h3>
          <p>
            A copy of the ticket would have been sent to you by e-mail when you
            booked the ticket. Please take a printout of that mail and produce
            it at the time of boarding. If you have not received your ticket to
            the e-mail id you provided, you can take a printout on Guzoye.com
            website by entering the PNR Number that was sent you by SMS while
            booking the ticket.
          </p>
          <h3>I have not received the tickets to my email id, what do I do?</h3>
          <p>
            If you did not receive an email after your conformation of the
            booking, there can be two reasons: The electronic credit card or
            debit payment has failed. In this case the purchase is cancelled by
            the system. You have entered an incorrect e-mail address. The email
            ticket has ended up in spam folder. Please check your bank statement
            first to see if your account/card was charged, please contact us in
            order to solve this problem. If your account was not charged, then
            you can retry the booking. If you have any further questions, please
            feel free to call our 24/7 customer support.
          </p>

        <div class="label">Refunds Related</div>
        <div class="content">
          <h3>I missed the bus, am I eligible for a refund?</h3>
          <p>
            Guzoye provides 100% refund if the bus is missed due to either
            Guzoye or its partner company's fault. However, if the bus is missed
            due to any other reasons not directly related to Guzoye it does not
            provide any refund (for example: waiting at the wrong pickup point
            or arriving late at the pickup point is not considered for refund).
          </p>
          <h3>
            I have cancelled my booking and when can I get the refund amount?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Generally all refunds are processed the same day or instantly in
            most cases. Money is transferred/refunded back to the passenger's
            credit/debit card/Bank account by the payment gateway within 24
            hours. After which depending on the customer’s bank, it takes 2-7
            working days to reflect the credit in your account.
          </p>
          <h3>Would I get a full refund?</h3>
          <p>
            Full refund happens only when there has been an error from
            Guzoye.com’s end or the bus partners end. In other cases, where the
            traveler requests for cancellation, partial refund happens. Please
            check the cancellation terms of the particular bus partner - these
            are mentioned on the ticket printout/Email. Or please contact our
            customer support for more details.

          <h3>What is a cash coupon and how do I claim it?</h3>
          <p>
            A cash coupon is slightly different from a discount coupon. Cash
            coupons can be used for single booking in the given time period.
            They are generally issued when helping the customer rebook tickets
            if there was an error from Guzoye.com end in an earlier booking.
          </p>
          <h3>Do you have any Discount Coupons that I can use?</h3>
          <p>Please check the offers page for any active offers.</p>
          <h3>I have a discount coupon but cannot get any discount</h3>
          <p>
            The discount coupon that you are using might have expired or has
            crossed its usage limit or is not applicable for the partner you
            selected. Every coupon has its own set of rules and these might be
            changed without notice for various reasons. However you can check
            the offers page for any active offers.
